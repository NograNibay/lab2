	<p> Seeking for your passion? For your “own thing”? We all have, at least for once in our life. And the only part we missed was to realize it. But maybe for some people, likes are different from interests, as it is different from passion. That is why I have created this post: to guide my readers into the paths of their own interests.</p>
	&quot; We don’t just wake up with our love for blogging &quot;
	<h3> FIRST THINGS, FIRST: Create a List of Interests </h3> 
	<h4> <ol> <li> Doing arts and crafts </li>
	<li> Listening to music </li>
	<li> Watching movies and TV series </li>
	<li> Reading books and comics </li>
	<li> Getting something to eat </li> 
	<li> Blogging </li></ol> </h4>
